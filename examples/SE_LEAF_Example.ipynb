    "# Soil Erosion LEAF Example\n",
    "In this example, Soil Erosion LEAF for *Maize, rainfed, plant residues removed, traditional tillage* production will be developed for a 2030 and 2050 scenario. The process assumes that the land use is kept the same, and that weather and crop data do not change over time, generating LEAF for the input land use map using the default values previously mentioned on [SOC Documentation](../documentation/SOC_Documentation.md). \n",
    "\n",
    "A similar approach can be implemented with a different land use map and/or using primary data regarding yields, plant cover, plant residues, soil and weather data. The methods can be changed to simulate crop rotations, organic amendments, multi-crop systems, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Download and Processing\n",
    "As explained in SOC Documentation, several data layers need to be downloaded first. This examples uses all potential locations where maize could be grown under rainfed conditions, according to [FAO GAEZ](https://www.fao.org/gaez/en/) v2. A newer version (v5 on the moment of publishing) has been released but to keep consistency with original SOC method framework it has not been updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soil & Weather\n",
    "Precipitation and air temperature data have been downloaded and processed. It be found under [data/](../data/). SoilGrids data have been downloaded and processed into UHTH zones in the needed format and is also available in the same folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "**🚧 TODO: Update reference 🚧**\n",
    "This data is too large to be be hosted in a github repository. Instructions into how to download it can be found on XXX\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crop Data\n",
    "Land use layer has been adapted from Morais, Teixeria & Domingos (2019) and can be found under [examples/soc_ex_data](../examples/soc_ex_data/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Commodity yield input data from FAO has already been summarized and can be found at [data/crops/fao_crop_yields_1423.csv](data/crops/fao_crop_yields_1423.csv) file. The needed SPAM data has been downloaded into [data/crops/spam2020V2r0_global_yield](data/crops/spam2020V2r0_global_yield) folder - only Maize data is uploaded, but other crops data layers are recommended to be placed under the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other needed data to calculate potential crop evapotranspiration, including pre-calculated PET-location based layer, $\\textstyle K_c$ values, stage durations, as well as other supporting data has been uploaded into [data/crops](../data/crops/) folder."
