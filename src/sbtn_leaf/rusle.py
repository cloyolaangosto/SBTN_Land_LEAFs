# RUSLE script description
'''
This module contains GIS implementation of 3 parameters of the RUSLE model, or the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, to estimate annual soil erosion for different commodities. The equation is as simple as:
A = R*K*L*C*P

Here, R, K, and L parameters are implemented. 
- R, which represents rainfall erosivity, depends on monthly precipitation. It's based on GloREDa, which publishes global monthly maps, are used as baseline. RCP scenarios are then overlaid to create new estimates.
- K, or soil erodibility, represents how easy the soil erodes, and of course depends on soil conditions. This is constant in time and is generated 1 time.
- L, or slope-length factor, is dimensionless and it's simply a factor that modifies erosion based on how long and steep the slope of the terrain is. This is also time-independent for human time horizons and is generated 1 time
