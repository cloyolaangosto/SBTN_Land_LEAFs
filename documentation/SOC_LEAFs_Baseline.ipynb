    "## Step 1 - Data Gathering and Preparation\n",
    "As explained in SOC Documentation, several data layers need to be gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 - Soil & Weather\n",
    "Precipitation and air temperature data have been downloaded and processed. It be found under [data/](../data/). SoilGrids data have been downloaded and processed into UHTH zones in the needed format and is also available in the same folder. \n",

    "This data is too large to be be hosted in a github repository. Instructions into how to download it can be found on XXX\n",

    "### 1.2 - Commodity Data\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 - Land use\n",
    "Land use layers have been adapted from Morais, Teixeria & Domingos (2019) and can be found under [data/land_use/](../data/land_use/). These layers include annual & permanent crops, forestry, and grasslands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2 - Annual & Permanent Crops\n",
    "##### 1.2.2.1 - Yields\n",
    "Commodity yield input data from FAO has already been summarized and can be found at [data/crops/fao_crop_yields_1423.csv](data/crops/fao_crop_yields_1423.csv) file. The needed SPAM data has been downloaded into [data/crops/spam2020V2r0_global_yield](data/crops/spam2020V2r0_global_yield) folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2.2.2 -Other data\n",
    "All other needed data based on yields, land use, and soil & weather, including potential crop evapotranspiration, pre-calculated PET-location based layer, $\\textstyle K_c$ values, stage durations, as well as other supporting data has been uploaded into [data/crops](../data/crops/) folder.\n",

    "#### 1.2.3 - Forests\n",
    "##### 1.2.3.1 - Litter\n",
    "Main source of carbon inputs through residues is the litter generated in forests. To estimate this, liter rates were obtained from table 3.2.1 of [IPCC 2003](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gpglulucf/gpglulucf_files/Chp3/Chp3_2_Forest_Land.pdf), and have been summarized in [forest_residues_IPCC](../data/forest/forest_residues_IPCC.xlsx) excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate litter rates, forest age need to be estimated. This were obtained from  the [Global Forest Age Dataset (GFAD)](https://research.wur.nl/en/datasets/the-global-forest-age-dataset-and-its-uncertainties-gfadv11) v1.1 is used. This dataset assigns the fraction of each grid cell to an age band (1-10, 11-20, ... 141-150) for 4 different forest types: Broadleaf Deciduous, Broadleaf Evergreen, Needleleaf Deciduous, and Needleleaf Evergreen.\n",

    "Full description of methods can be found on [SOC_LEAFs_Forest_Support](../documentation/SOC_Support/SOC_LEAFs_Forest_Support.ipynb) notebook. \n",

    "##### 1.2.3.2 -Other data\n",
    "All other needed data based on yields, land use, and soil & weather has already been processed for crops. No further water requirements calculations beside precipitation is needed.\n",
