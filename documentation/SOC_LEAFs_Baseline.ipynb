    "## Step 1 - Data Gathering and Preparation\n",
    "As explained in SOC Documentation, several data layers need to be gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 - Soil & Weather\n",
    "Precipitation and air temperature data have been downloaded and processed. It be found under [data/](../data/). SoilGrids data have been downloaded and processed into UHTH zones in the needed format and is also available in the same folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "**🚧 TODO: Update reference 🚧**\n",
    "This data is too large to be be hosted in a github repository. Instructions into how to download it can be found on XXX\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 - Commodity Data\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 - Land use\n",
    "Land use layers have been adapted from Morais, Teixeria & Domingos (2019) and can be found under [data/land_use/](../data/land_use/). These layers include annual & permanent crops, forestry, and grasslands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2 - Annual & Permanent Crops\n",
    "##### 1.2.2.1 - Yields\n",
    "Commodity yield input data from FAO has already been summarized and can be found at [data/crops/fao_crop_yields_1423.csv](data/crops/fao_crop_yields_1423.csv) file. The needed SPAM data has been downloaded into [data/crops/spam2020V2r0_global_yield](data/crops/spam2020V2r0_global_yield) folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2.2.2 -Other data\n",
    "All other needed data based on yields, land use, and soil & weather, including potential crop evapotranspiration, pre-calculated PET-location based layer, $\\textstyle K_c$ values, stage durations, as well as other supporting data has been uploaded into [data/crops](../data/crops/) folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.3 - Forests\n",
    "LEAFs are developed for Broadleaf Deciduous (BRDC) and Needleleaf Evergreen (NEEV) forests for different climate zones, including:\n",
    "    1. Boreal, dry\n",
    "    2. Boreal, moist\n",
    "    3. Cold temperate, dry\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that not all combinations exist, and thus not all are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant cover is assumed constant through the year.\n",
    "##### 1.2.3.1 - Litter\n",
    "Main source of carbon inputs through residues is the litter generated in forests. To estimate this, liter rates were obtained from table 3.2.1 of [IPCC 2003](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gpglulucf/gpglulucf_files/Chp3/Chp3_2_Forest_Land.pdf), and have been summarized in [forest_residues_IPCC](../data/forest/forest_residues_IPCC.xlsx) excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate litter rates, forest age need to be estimated. This were obtained from  the [Global Forest Age Dataset (GFAD)](https://research.wur.nl/en/datasets/the-global-forest-age-dataset-and-its-uncertainties-gfadv11) v1.1 is used. This dataset assigns the fraction of each grid cell to an age band (1-10, 11-20, ... 141-150) for 4 different forest types: Broadleaf Deciduous, Broadleaf Evergreen, Needleleaf Deciduous, and Needleleaf Evergreen.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the age dataset estimates forest age for 2010. As SOC baseline is for 2016, it has been assumed that no disturbances have occurred between 2010 and 2016. Also, no management practices have been implemented thus far, and should be incorporated in the future for better representation of forest plantations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2.3.2 -Other data\n",
    "All other needed data based on yields, land use, and soil & weather has already been processed for crops. No further water requirements calculations beside precipitation is needed.\n",

    "#### 1.2.4 - Grassland\n",
    "For the moment, only natural grasslands have been generated. Managed grasslands are a natural next steps and support in their development is welcome.\n",

    "Plant cover is assumed constant through the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2.4.1 - Plant Residues\n",
    "Resides, both above- and below-ground biomass were obtained from Table 6.4 of the [2006 IPCC - Grasslands](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_06_Ch6_Grassland.pdf) methodology report for the different thermal zones, which were then converted into FAO climate zones. Data can be found on [grassland_residues_IPCC](../data/grasslands/grassland_residues_IPCC.xlsx) excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Annual plant residues are then distributed evenly through each month. \n",
    "##### 1.2.4.2 - Animals Manure or Dung\n",
    "Animal manure is another source of carbon in grasslands. For this, an average amount of animals per hectares, including cattle, sheep and goat was determined per uhth pixel using FAO's [Gridded livestock density v4](https://data.apps.fao.org/catalog/dataset/9d1e149b-d63f-4213-978b-317a8eb42d02). Total amount of carbon from animal deposition was then calculated by using  [IPCC 2019](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/pdf/4_Volume4/19R_V4_Ch10_Livestock.pdf) annual nitrogen depositions per head per continent and [FAO's Farmer’s Compost Handbook—Experiences in Latin America](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/0658b4e0-53e3-4ed7-89d0-ff351bec1dff/content) C:N ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "IPCC 2019 information was then mapped into each uhth pixel. Some continents offer 3 productivity systems for cattle: high, average, and low, which should be run separately. \n",
    "Annual animal residues are then distributed evenly through each month. \n",

    "##### 1.2.4.3 -Other data\n",
    "All other needed data based on yields, land use, and soil & weather has already been processed for crops. \n",
    "\n",
    "Irrigation requirements could be calculated with $\\textstyle K_c$ curves with data been provided under [K_Crop_Data.csv](../data/crops/K_Crop_Data.csv). For grasses with multiple harvest a year, new functions should be build or adapted from current ones.\n",
